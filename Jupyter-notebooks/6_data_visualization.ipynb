Each point represents a household, with colors indicating whether climate information and agricultural advisory was received (“Yes” in light blue, “No” in orange). This visualization highlights how maize productivity varies with education and access to advisory services."

    "### Insights from the survey data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agricultural practices and productivity:** There is a wide variability in **cultivated land acres** and **maize yield**. The scatter plots show that there is no clear positive correlation between **cultivated land acres** and **maize yield**, indicating that simply having more land doesn't guarantee a higher yield. This suggests that **land management practices** are more important than the size of the land itself. Business cases could be built around providing farmers with training on efficient farming techniques, such as crop rotation, soil management, or improved irrigation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role of climate information and agri-advisories:** Households that have access to **advisories** information** generally seem to have a more consistent and potentially higher maize yield, as indicated by the scatter plots. While not suggesting a causal link, the data shows that providing farmers with timely and accurate climate data could lead to more informed decisions regarding planting, irrigation, and harvesting, thereby improving crop yields. Policy recommendations should include investing in accessible weather forecasting services and developing easy-to-use platforms to disseminate climate information and agricultural advice to farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Organic fertilizer usage:** The graph showing **Maize Yield vs Organic Fertilizer** suggests that while many households use organic fertilizer, there isn't a strong positive correlation between the amount used and the maize yield. This may indicate a lack of understanding regarding the correct application or type of organic fertilizer. Advisories could focus on educating farmers about proper fertilizer application rates and methods to maximize their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Education and its impact on livelihoods:** The most common education level among households is **Secondary**, followed by **Primary** and **Undergraduate degrees**. There is a noticeable gender disparity, with **males being significantly more educated** than females across all levels, particularly at the Secondary and Diploma levels. These results suggests the need for targeted gender-sensitive advisory services, to ensure equitable access to and benefits from information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact of advisory services on maize yield:** The last boxplot figure indicates that households with access to advisory tend to have higher and less variable maize yields compared to those without. At the same time, the yield don't seem to be directly related to the education level of the household head. This is not suprising, as yield outcomes are influenced by many other factors, as shown in previously presented results. \n",
